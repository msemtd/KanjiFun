# KanjiFun

Animated 3D SVG Kanji flashcards in an electron app.

I really like the SVG animated strokes on https://jisho.org/

I am learning Japanese and Kanji is one of the more complicated aspects but I think it is also very rewarding. Put in a lot of effort and get out a lot of reward.

## Data Management

We could bundle everything - but would that be right?
* there's a lot of licenses to consider - many people's hard work
* we need the data in a usable form - there may be some transformations and pre-processing to do
Download of releases of data packages in a programatic way.
* https://github.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg/releases
* kanjivg-20230110-all.zip is under a little under 22 megabytes
Some things are already available as NPM distributed packages
* kanjivganimate

* static directory in electron bundle - maybe not appropriate
* electron app data directory
